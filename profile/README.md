4thTech is a Block Labs project, the developer framework for pioneering the future of global on-chain communication. 

- EVM framework that enables 1000s of email, messaging and data management apps to evolve on Web3.
- Seamless SDK interactions with protocol smart contracts, storage providers, encryption methods, and the Encryptor Extension.
- SDK-supported end-user Encryptor extension stands ready to enable E2E communication encryption with user-owned private keys.
- SDK-supported decentralized storage via PollinationX.
- Open source permissionless SDK and White-label access.

## Start Building

A permissionless Level-2 integrator licence is available via Level-1 integrator [Immu3](https://wiki.immu3.io/) and is perfect for teams wanting to build their on-chain communication dApps. Enterprise Level-1 integrator licence is available via Block Labs and is meant for traditional businesses or offices, L1s, wallets, and existing applications.

ðŸ’¡**OCC SDK** provides abstractions to assist you with interacting with the OCC Protocol v.1 smart contracts in a Typescript/Javascript environment. With the OCC SDK, you can manipulate data that has been queried from the EVM using libraries that assist with needs such as data modelling, protection from rounding errors, and compiling time-enforced typing.

ðŸ’¡**BlockMail & BlockChat White-label UIs** enables fast and easy builds. White-label-based modern minimalistic design style emphasizes simplicity with simple intuitive but effective navigation and setup system. A simple user interface has been developed to offer a step-by-step setup enabling the best possible user experience.

Block Labs project that was built as a Web3 on-chain communication infrastructure technology proposal occupying L1, protocol, SDK and encryption layers. The project aims to:
- enable permissionless multi-chain (i.e. 20+ L1) communication standard that enables 1000s of dMail & dChat dApps to evolve on Web3, via TypeScript SDKs & White-labels, while it's core Web3 primitive; one message = one L1 transaction utilises L1s security to enable immutable E2EE W2W on-chain communication,
- develop the concept for on-chain communication-specific L1,
- contribute to the next Web3 adoption wave, and
- pioneer the future of encrypted, immutable and decentralized on-chain communication.

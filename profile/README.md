4thpillar Technologies or short 4thTech is the next-gen multi-blockchain
ecosystem, platform, cryptocurrency, and a suite of decentralized applications
that enable users to send, receive private dMails or exchange E2EE on-chain messages 
with no possibility of data mining or data tracking.

With a charter to establish foundation for:

- decentralized digital identity (i.e. dID);
- multi-chain data exchange (i.e. dMail);
- data notarisation (i.e. dNotary);
- on-chain instant messaging (i.e. dChat)
- decentralization of cloud storage.

4thTech initiative strives to enable a self-sovereign framework of data
authorization and ownership representation and leverages the power of blockchain
to facilitate data source and time confirmation.

Established already in 2017, the initiative is composed of individuals and
companies who collaborate to create decentralized solutions for the benefit of
everyone, compatible and in line with European Blockchain services
infrastructure and usable or extendable globally.
